Even though the weather decided to shower us with rain, it did nothing to dampen the spirits of those present.

           With umbrellas and raincoats in hand, the students continued with their planned celebration, showing remarkable resilience and enthusiasm. The event opened with heartfelt speeches, where students expressed their appreciation for the unwavering guidance and support of their teachers. Each speech was a reflection of the immense gratitude the students felt for their mentors, who have been instrumental in shaping their academic journeys.

Every performance was met with applause, with teachers visibly touched by the dedication their students demonstrated.
